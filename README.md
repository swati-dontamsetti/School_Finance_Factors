# School Finance: Which Factors Effect Public School Performance?
<hr>
## Abstract
Education is meant to be the great equalizer that will allow all children, regardless of ethnicity, sexuality, gender expression, or familial economic status, to rise through the socioeconomic ranks to achieve a better future than generations before them. However, schools just reproduce the same inequalities that exist in the larger society. And as we live in a capitalist society, money plays a prominent role in access to and quality of resources that schools have to support their students’ growth and close inequity gaps. I use the Taxpayers’ Guide to Education Spending (2020) and the New Jersey School Performance Reports (2016-2017 & 2018-2019) from the NJ Department of Education website to compare each district in NJ’s spending activities and their school rankings. The data allows me to see how school spending and school rankings line up and investigate if there are specific categories of spending (i.e. teacher salaries, school supplies, support staff costs, etc.) that play a statistically significant role in the rankings of schools in NJ. While a district’s poverty level has the biggest impact on school rankings, I find three areas where increased spending significantly impacts school ranking.
